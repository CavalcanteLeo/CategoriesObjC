/*!
 With this file compiled as part of your project which uses
 GCUndoManager as its undo manager(s), you can see if and when
 your app is sending the correct messages for undo and change
 management.
 
 Each line in the console log shows if an undo group was begun or
 ended, and the old and new values of the three important Undo
 Manager states, in this form
 <began|ended>  {<stateName> <oldStateValue>:<newStateValue>, â€¦}

 For example, here are the messages logged when running the
 GCUndoManagerTestbed app through a simple do-undo-redo-undo cycle:
 
 APPLICATION LAUNCHED:
 Replaced -updateChangeCount in NSDocument for debugging.
 Replaced -beginUndoGrouping and -endUndoGrouping in GCUndoManager for debugging.
 
 EDIT SOMETHING UNDOABLE:
