 @brief    Methods for working with hierarchical tab views, which means tabs
 whose views or subviews of its tab view items also contain ("sub") tab views.
 */
@interface NSTabViewItem (SSYTabHierarchy)

/*
 @brief    Returns self, unless the receiver's view contains a (sub) tab view, 
 then returns the selected tab view item of the first such sub tab view, unless
 the view of that item contans a (subsub) tab view, then returns the selected
 tab view item of the first subsub tab view, etc. recursively until a leaf tab
 view item is found.
 
 @details  This method has some safety built into it.  If self, or any leaf item
 found during the recursion, does not respond as required (typically because the
 items is a NSTabViewItem but not a SSYHierarchicalTabViewItem), this method 
 stops and returns the deepest tab view item it has already found.  No
 exception is raised.
 
 The phrase "first â€¦ tab view" means the first in the array -[NSView subviews].
 You should probably have only one of these, unless you want to confuse users
 even more than having hierarchical tab view items already does :))
 
 @result   The tab view item returned is often the receiver itself.

 brief    Searches the receiver's view and the descendant views (subviews,
 subsubviews, etc.) of this view until it finds an NSTabView, returning this
 item or nil if none was found
 
 @details  The search is depth-first.  This works as expected if there is only
 one such tab view in the descendant views.
